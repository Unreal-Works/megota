## Security Best Practices

- We donâ€™t store or process any user credentials, API keys, or tokens. If you find any, thatâ€™s actually a bug. Pls snitch on us (see above).
- All dependencies should be kept up-to-date. If you spot a sus package, let us know.
- Donâ€™t trust random code or PRs. Review before merging. Touch grass before approving suspicious changes.
- Contributions must **not** include secrets or sensitive data. Weâ€™ll roast you forever if you do.

## Responsible Disclosure

Help us keep the ecosystem safe for everyone. If you vibe with responsible disclosure, we vibe with you.
